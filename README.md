# SBA-316-DOM
For this project, I created a simple push-your-luck game.

Players have 3 attempts to collect points, but will also collect threats, if 3 of the same type of threat are collected, the game ends.

Only banked points count toward the final score. 
Banking will remove all threats, but also end the current run.

technical accomplishments

getElements and change properties
use onclick, mouseover, mouseoff events
