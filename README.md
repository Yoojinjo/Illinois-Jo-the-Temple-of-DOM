# SBA-316-DOM

Description
For this project, I created a simple push-your-luck game in the style of the baordgame Incan Gold.

Rules
1) Players have 3 attempts to collect points, but will also collect threats, if 3 of the same type of threat are collected, the game ends.
2) Only banked points count toward the final score. 
3) Banking will remove all threats, but also end the current run.

Built with
HTML / CSS / Javascript

Technical accomplishments
1) DOM Manipulation
create, get, remove elements in JS
getElements and change properties
2) JS events
use onclick, mouseover, mouseoff events
3) Array methods / functions
iterate through array to check if game ends
created multiple functions and sub-functions
4) use JS to modify CSS

Unresolved issues before assignment submission
-data validation where form will not store to local storage if name field is empty. 
-unable to make submit button functional
