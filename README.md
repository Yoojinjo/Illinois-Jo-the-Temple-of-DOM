# SBA-316-DOM
For this project, I created a simple push-your-luck game.

Players have 3 attempts to collect points, but will also collect threats, if 3 of the same type of threat are collected, the game ends.

Only banked points count toward the final score. 
Banking will remove all threats, but also end the current run.

technical accomplishments
create, get, remove elements in JS
getElements and change properties
use onclick, mouseover, mouseoff events
iterate through array to check if game ends
created multiple functions and sub-functions
use JS to modify CSS

currently stuck on data validation where form will not store to local storage if name field is empty. Also can't figure out why submit button is non functional
